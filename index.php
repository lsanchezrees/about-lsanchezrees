		<h1>About Leonora Sanchez-Rees</h1>
		<p>I have had several careers so far.  I have a BA in Anthropology, and an MA in Linguistics.
			I then got an AAS in Information Systems and worked as a programmer and systems analyst for
		several years.  My next incarnation was as an acupuncturist and D.O.M.  I then met my husband, got married, and...
		returned to New Mexico, which has more acupuncturists per capita then Beijing.  I have just recently completed
		a Certificate in Web Design, which involved a lot of HTML and CSS and a little JavaScript and PHP.</p>
		<p>I am married to a wonderful man named Brian.  My hobbies are hiking and reading, and I have a dog, Lucy, who is incredibly sweet and adorable.  She is a shy
			little girl who loves to hunt lizards and bugs and loves to eat bees.  (I'm not kidding about that last
		thing.)  I also love to travel and have been to 5 continents.  For our honeymoon, my husband and I hiked the
		Inca Trail to Machu Picchu.</p>
		<p>Since I have no pictures of myself on this laptop, I'll have to substitute a picture of Lucy, my
		pointer mix, and Bailey, my beloved Katrina rescue who died last year.</p>
