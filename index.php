		<h1>About Leonora Sanchez-Rees</h1>
		<p>I have had several careers so far.  I have a BA in Anthropology, and an MA in Linguistics.
			I then got an AAS in Information Systems and worked as a programmer and systems analyst for
		several years.  My next incarnation was as an acupuncturist and D.O.M.  I then met my husband, got married, and...
		returned to New Mexico, which has more acupuncturists per capita then Beijing.  I have just recently completed
		a Certificate in Web Design, which involved a lot of HTML and CSS and a little JavaScript and PHP.</p>
		<p>I am married to a great guy named Brian.  He works for LANL.  My hobbies are hiking and reading, and I have
			a dog, Lucy, who is incredibly sweet and adorable.  She is a shy
			little girl who loves to hunt lizards and bugs and loves to eat bees.  (I'm not kidding about that last
		thing.)  I also love to travel and have been to 5 continents.  For our honeymoon, my husband and I hiked the
		Inca Trail to Machu Picchu.</p>
		<p>The picture below is the only picture of myself I could find on my phone.  It's a picture of my husband, Brian
		and I at Ayers Rock, Australia.  We're taking a camel ride to a dinner under the stars.</p>
		<p>The picture next to it is a picture of my dogs, Bailey and Lucy.  Bailey was a Katrina rescue who died last
		year.  We got Lucy in December 2014. </p>

		<p>Before ending up in the New Mexico desert, Leonora spent the past three years backpacking through Europe.
			Her travels first took her through the mountains of Austria where she trenched through the brutal winter
			blizzards and took shelter in a cave belonging to none other than the infamous Yeti. After a lengthy battle,
			Leonora emerged victorious and continued on her journey.
		</p>
		<p>
			After Austria, she ventured into Spanish backcountry where she spent time in Spain's finest
			vineyards and became a master winemaker.  After bottling up one last rioja for the road, she continued her
			journey.

			The last stop on Leonora's journey through Europe landed her in France. After picking up the French language
			in two days to the level of a native speaker, she then began studying the works of Monet in order to
			reproduce exact copies of some of his most famous works. Just for the fun of it. That afternoon she sailed
			back to the United States on a boat she made herself. Now that she is back in the U.S., when Leonora is not
			in class she can be found at the bar drinking a Dos Equis and swapping stories with someone known only as
			"the most interesting man in the world".
